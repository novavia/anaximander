A brief survey of personality type systems
JD Margulici, April 2023
This short article introduces a handful of personality type systems that I have found useful to better 
understand both myself and other people. What is striking about these different systems is that they 
adopt widely varying perspectives on the nature of the human psyche and end up providing 
complementary rather than competing depictions. However, by the same token, none of the systems has 
strong scientific backing, with the exception of the Positive Psychology framework, and both the Myers-
Briggs and the Enneagram deservedly get called “pseudo-science” -and hence their value is ultimately 
subjective. A more academically grounded system of personality types is the so-called Big Five 
personality traits model. I don’t review it here, primarily because it is rather plain and self-explanatory, 
and interested readers can consult the Wikipedia article.
I give my own take on each system with a short description of its tenets and structure, and I additionally 
include resources for those interested in diving in. Online self-assessments designed to determine one’s 
personality type or traits within each system are available, some free, some fee-based, and professional 
assistance can be obtained as well. The systems that I cover are:
•	The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
•	The Enneagram
•	Positive Psychology’s Character Strengths
•	Clifton Strengths
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), often abbreviated as simply Myers-Briggs, is assuredly the 
better-known personality type system presented here. It was developed in the middle of the 20th 
Century by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers, inspired by Carl Jung’s own 
theories of personality types.
The MBTI framework is neatly structured around four personality functions, each of which is modeled as 
a pair of opposing polarities, as follows:
•	Introversion/Extroversion (I/E): This is generally the most easily understood function. However, it 
is important to emphasize that it does not necessarily describe one’s behavior, as in being shy or 
outgoing. Rather, extroverts are those who feel energized by social interactions, whereas 
introverts must expend energy in social situations, and need solitude to recharge.
•	Sensing/Intuition (S/N): Some people apprehend the world primarily through their sensory 
inputs, and that anchors them into a more present and evidence-based outlook. By contrast, 
those who tend toward intuition draw on past experiences and fit information into patterns. As a 
result, sensing types tend to reason through bottom-up inferences, whereas intuitive types tend 
toward a top-down process. This trait also conditions communication styles, with sensing types 
preferring concrete language and intuitive types using more abstract concepts.
•	Thinking/Feeling (T/F): The thinking-feeling function deals with decision making. As one would 
expect, thinkers prioritize logic and consistency to attain rational objectives. Feelers rely more on 
their heart and connect to situations through feelings and empathy, generally seeking harmony.
•	Judging/Perceiving (J/P): The last function determines whether we tend to more often manifest 
decision-making (judging) or information gathering (perceiving) in outward behavior. In each 
case, the behavior is conditioned by one’s corresponding functional preference (T/F for decision-
making, or S/N for information gathering): hence a TJ type will outwardly demonstrate rational 
decision making, whereas a NP type appears to intuitively absorb their environment. 
Supposedly, we manifest the opposing tendency in our inner world, so the TJ type may use 
solitude to sort out information, and the NP type may channel observations toward privately 
making decisions. Generally, J types appear more organized and task-oriented, whereas P types 
appear more casual and adaptive.
While every individual’s natural inclination lies somewhere between the two extremes in each function, 
one side will generally be favored. This theoretically leads to 24=16 possible personality types. The types 
are described by combinations of letters (e.g. ISTJ, ENFP, etc.), but some authors add a qualifier to 
succinctly describe each type -a simple web search will readily return several examples. I will not attempt 
to describe individual types, since this is best left to experts and would occupy more space than I intend. 
However, two salient facts deserve mention. The first one is that each type is markedly distinct from the 
others, even though as one would expect, adjacent types (e.g. ESTJ and ESFJ) bear more resemblance to 
one another than do those that differ in every dimension (e.g. ESTJ and INFP). The second point worth 
mentioning is that the types are not equally distributed across a randomly sampled population, and 
some types are more frequent than others -INTJ and INFJ types are the rarest types, representing 1-2% 
of a western population, whereas each of the ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ and ESFJ types gather 10% or more.
One author, David Keirsey, and his co-author Marilyn Bates, group the types into four broad 
temperament types. I mention this here as it can help make sense of the overall system through a more 
tractable set of archetypes than the fully expanded 16 types:
•	SPs (ISTP, ISFP, ESTP, ESFP), dubbed artisans, tend to focus on concrete, tactical skills. They are 
athletes, musicians, mechanics, surgeons, and so on.
•	SJs (ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, ESFJ), nicknamed guardians, value institutions and excel as logisticians. They 
are the most common category, and tend toward professions that sustain the social fabric, such 
as teachers or corporate managers.
•	NTs (INTJ, ENTP, INTP, ENTJ) are called rationals. They trust their intellectual intuitions and are 
natural strategists, many choosing scientific careers.
•	NFs (INFJ, ENFP, INFP, ENFJ) are the idealists, who are drawn to imagination and empathy. They 
excel at diplomacy and gravitate toward people-oriented roles.

The Enneagram of Personality
Whereas the MBTI provides a logically organized set of categories derived from its component functions, 
the Enneagram exudes esoterism. The system defines nine basic personality types, universally numbered 
1 through 9, though some authors attach a nickname to each type. In its modern form, the Enneagram 
was initially proposed by Bolivian philosopher Oscar Ichazo, and subsequently developed by Claudio 
Naranjo, a Chilean-born psychiatrist. However, the Enneagram has been linked to multiple mythological 
and mystic traditions, including early Christian mysticism, the myth of Odysseus, whose journey home 
comprises nine adventures that symbolize the personality types, and the nine circles of Inferno in 
Dante’s Divine Comedy.
One interpretation of the Enneagram is that it represents the primary human neuroses or essential sins, 
all of which afflict each of us to some degree. At the same time, one unconsciously gravitates toward a 
dominant passion, which drives our ego and compulsions, but also determines the path to our salvation -
if we can integrate our shadow side and sublimate vice into virtue. As many spiritual and psychological 
authors have remarked, self-actualization is largely a matter of knowing oneself. According to the 
Enneagram system, this journey of the soul follows one of nine archetypical profiles. Hence, discovering 
one’s Enneagram type is a way to access a tailored template to guide psychological work. This can be 
particularly useful considering that the features of our type tend to stay hidden from consciousness, 
which is what gives them power over our personality.
The nine types of the Enneagram are depicted as evenly distributed points lined around a circle. This 
structure defines relationships between the types that add meaning and complexity to their 
interpretation. One of these relationships is a grouping of types into three triads of three types each. The 
triads identify three ‘centers of intelligence’, roughly defined as body center (types 8, 9 and 1), heart 
center (types 2, 3 and 4) and intellectual center (types 5, 6, and 7). This doesn’t necessarily mean that 
type 5, 6 and 7 are more cerebral than other types. Rather, it points to the necessary path toward 
integration. In this view, intellectual center types will find redemption by focusing on their mind, heart 
center types must focus on their emotions, and body center types must pay attention to the physical 
plane.
Each Enneagram type is further divided into three subtypes, which pertain to the individual’s social 
orientation -either “self-preserving” (introverted), “intimate” (focused on key relationships) or “social” 
(extroverted). Another possible type variation comes from the adjacency between neighboring types, 
which can add so-called wings to one’s personality. For instance, a type 9 may feature either an 8-wing, a 
1-wing, both simultaneously, or neither. Finally, types are linked across the circle by connecting lines. 
These lines represent a sort of intrinsic evolutionary flow between the types. Each type is connected to 
two other types on the circle, with one type corresponding to progress or integration, and the other type 
corresponding to stress and regression. As an individual actualizes, they tend to behave more like their 
integration type, although the primary type still dominates. Conversely, when one gets stuck by 
circumstances, their behavior tends toward their stress type. Hence the connecting lines add a dynamic 
dimension to one’s soul journey, where the stress and integration points can be interpreted as origin and 
destination.
As can probably be inferred from this description, the Enneagram stands out as a personality type 
system. While it is rooted in psychological characteristics, it also bears accents of astrology in that it 
suggests an ordained destiny. It is only natural to approach personality types as a means to obtain 
answers about who we are and how we fit into the world. With the Enneagram, however, one should 
initially expect more questions than answers. From my experience, it must be construed as an invitation 
to embark on a journey of personal discovery and growth, belying a spiritual orientation that is different 
from the resolutely more business mindedness of other systems.

Positive Psychology’s Character Strengths
Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman popularized the field of positive psychology and published 
their Character Strengths and Virtues Handbook in 2004. This work inventories 24 character strengths 
grouped under six virtues (wisdom & knowledge, courage, humanity, justice, temperance and 
transcendence), and is motivated by the core tenet of the positive psychology movement, which is to 
leverage psychological research to help people attain well-being and self-actualization -thus contrasting 
with the traditional focus of psychological science on pathologies, and building on the foundations set by 
earlier authors such as Maslow, Rollo May and Carl Rogers.
The handbook does not readily provide the means for self-assessment. Its theories are embodied into a 
proprietary operational framework that is commercialized under a ‘freemium’ business model as the VIA 
Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS). VIA offers a self-service online assessment that allows one to discover 
their signature strengths. The result is a ranking that indicates a participant’s relative affinity to each of 
the 24 strengths. Positive psychology posits that low-ranked strengths are not what an individual should 
focus on -in other words, don’t turn these into weaknesses requiring improvement. Instead, the top 
handful of strengths, dubbed signature strengths, point us to our natural inclinations, where our 
potential for further development is the greatest.
Unlike the Myers-Briggs and the Enneagram, the character strengths have been developed under a 
somewhat rigorous experimental framework, though the assessment is by no means perfect in terms of 
its reliability and validity. Also, given its format as an ordered list of signature strengths picked among a 
relatively large set, the inventory of strengths does not exactly deliver a type or category -an arguably 
rigid and unrealistic feature of type systems. Rather, the assessment provides a highly individualized map 
for people to better understand how they can thrive, both intimately and socially.

Clifton Strengths
Clifton Strengths closely resembles the VIA Inventory of Strengths in its format and philosophy. This 
framework was initially developed by Donald O. Clifton, another positive psychology researcher and 
entrepreneur. It is the intellectual property of Gallup, Inc., which commercializes it as a personality type 
assessment under the name CliftonStrengths.
Both the methods of self-assessment and the interpretation of results align with the VIA-IS. However, 
probably because of Gallup’s core business as a management consulting organization, the Clifton 
Strengths test is deliberately more oriented toward professional endeavors. There are 34 strengths, 
actually called themes, that are divided into four domains: strategic thinking, relationship building, 
influencing, and executing. Further, the results of the test can be leveraged by individuals but are also 
frequently shared at the level of work teams or entire organizations, as a means to foster more effective 
collaboration. Note that some consulting organizations use the MBTI for the same purpose, in effect 
looking at personality profiles to build stronger teams.
